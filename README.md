Generation of Brain Tumor Diagnostic Reports from MRI scans using Large Language Model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Medical imaging systems for tumor detection in MRI scans face significant diagnostic challenges due to the complexity of identifying subtle and irregular anomalies. Traditional methods often struggle to provide accurate and reliable reports, particularly in cases involving intricate anatomical variations or ambiguous tumor boundaries. This research proposes an innovative approach to generate comprehensive human-readable reports that integrate both visual and textual insights, thereby enhancing detection accuracy and supporting clinical decision-making.

The proposed model focuses on critical regions of MRI scans to accurately identify subtle and irregular tumor boundaries while minimizing the loss of important features during processing. A Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) enhances feature representation by highlighting key regions, improving the delineation of small or diffuse tumor subregions. Deep Supervision is integrated to facilitate multi-scale learning, preserving fine details and ensuring better segmentation performance.

To improve explainability, the system combines enhanced visual features with textual modalities using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA, generating interpretable reports that provide clinicians with clear decision-making insights. The model effectively handles heterogeneous tumor appearances, addressing generalization issues observed in conventional segmentation methods. Overall, this approach advances MRI-based tumor detection by refining feature representation, improving segmentation of challenging regions, and producing interpretable, LLM-driven reports to support clinical workflows.
